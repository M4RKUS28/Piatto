### 3. Focus Indicators

All interactive elements have visible 2px Forest Green (#035035) outline:
- Buttons: `outline: 2px solid #035035` with `outline-offset: 2px`

Focus indicators only appear for keyboard navigation (`:focus-visible`), not mouse clicks.

### 4. Form Label Association

All form inputs properly associated with labels:
- Prompt input: `<label htmlFor="prompt-input">` → `<textarea id="prompt-input">`
- Ingredients input: `<label htmlFor="ingredients-input">` → `<textarea id="ingredients-input">`
- Image upload: `<label htmlFor="image-upload">` → `<input id="image-upload">`

Labels are visible (not screen-reader only) for better usability.

### 5. Error Message Announcements

All error messages use `aria-live` regions for screen reader announcements:
- Validation errors: `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Network/server errors: `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`
- Error messages are associated with inputs via `aria-describedby`
- Inputs have `aria-invalid="true"` when errors are present

### 6. Image Alt Text

All images have descriptive alt text:
- Recipe preview images: `alt="${recipe.title} - Recipe preview image"`
- Decorative SVG icons: `aria-hidden="true"` to hide from screen readers
- Functional images have descriptive alt text that conveys purpose

### 7. Color Contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA)

#### Body Text (4.5:1 minimum)
- Primary text (#2D2D2D on #FFFFFF): 15.8:1 ✓
- Forest Green (#035035 on #FFFFFF): 8.9:1 ✓

### 8. Step Indicators

Current step is indicated with `aria-current="step"`:
- Step 1: `aria-current="step"` when active
- Step 2: `aria-current="step"` when active
- Step 3: `aria-current="step"` when active
- Visual indicator shows current step with Forest Green background
- Text label below indicators announces current step

- Loading states: `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Success messages: `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Error messages: `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`

### 10. Semantic HTML

Proper semantic HTML structure:
- Forms use `<form>` elements with proper `aria-label`
- Headings use proper hierarchy (h2 for step titles)
- Buttons use `<button>` elements (not divs)
- Lists use proper list markup with `role="list"` and `role="listitem"`
