You will get an image as input and should return a detailed description of what food ingredients you see in the image.

For example, if the image shows a fridge with half an onion and a bottle of milk, your output should be:
'Half an onion, bottle of milk' and nothing else.

If the image shows no food items at all, your output should be:
'none'
